#  Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

A dedicated space where I document my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. After realizing that "tutorial hell" doesn't build muscle memory, I created this repository to focus on **active implementation**, logic-building, and code efficiency.

##  The Philosophy
This isn't just a collection of solutions. It is a log of my "Mental Gym" sessions. Each problem includes:
* **The Logic:** A breakdown of how to approach the problem.
* **The Code:** Clean, readable Python implementations.
* **Efficiency:** Analysis of Time Complexity ($O(n)$) and Space Complexity.

##  Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Tools:** VS Code, LeetCode, NeetCode
* **Concepts:** Time/Space Complexity Analysis

##  Why I'm Doing This
In the age of AI, I believe understanding the *underlying architecture* of code is what separates a coder from an engineer. This repo is my way of ensuring I can explain the "Why" behind every line of code I write.
